What is terraform?

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, 
or optionally JSON.

It is useful in case of of multicloud and hybrid cloud.
It uses hashicrop configure language, it is similar to json but easy and human readable.


Infrastructure as code (IAC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manula process.


===================================================
There are two ways to approach IAC:
A: Imperative & B: Declarative.
1: Imperative: Imperative approach defines the specific commands needed to achieve the desired configuration and those commands then needs to be executed in correct order.
2: Declarative: It defines the desired steps of the system, including what resources you need and any properties they should have and and IAC tool will configure for you. 
Basically declarative way does not require correct steps to be executed to get the expected output.
